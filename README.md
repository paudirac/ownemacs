# Ownemacs

## Preface

A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Emacs, 
the author of this config found, in an obscure nook of one of the 
infinite blogs, the following code, engraved by hand upon the startup 
screen:

        CODE

These ASCII capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in the virtual 
stone, with I know not what signs peculiar to Terminal caligraphy imprinted 
upon their forms and upon their attitudes, as though with the purpose of 
revealing that it had been a hand of the 70s which had inscribed them there,
and especially the fatal and melancholy meaning contained in them, struck 
the author deeply.
He questioned himself; he sought to divine who could have been that soul in 
torment which had not been willing to quit this world without leaving this 
stigma of crime or unhappiness upon the brow of the Ancient Editor.

It is upon this word that this config is founded.

September, 2017.

## Notes

I'm doing fine with [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/), but there is a time
when you have to talk with your Emacs yourself.

Because the more probable is to mess it up irreversibly at some point, I will 
not stop using internet-proven Emacs setups, so to change from multiple Emacs 
setups, I'll use [the easiest I could came with](https://gist.github.com/paudirac/6924b16c340ed8aae3eab0a4912b9cb1).

## Disclaimer

This is for my own use only (I mean, this is its only purpose at the time of
writting).
